    <p>The original incarnation of Goku in the Dragon Ball prototype Dragon Boy was Tangtong. The original inspirations for that story were Hong Kong martial arts films, including Bruce Lee films such as Enter the Dragon (1973) and Jackie Chan films such as Drunken Master (1978); Toriyamalater said he had a young Jackie Chan in mind for a live-action Goku</p>

        Son Gohan (孫そん悟ご飯はん Son Gohan) is a half-breed Saiyan and one of the most prominent characters in the Dragon Ball series. He is the elder son of the series' primary protagonist Goku and his wife Chi-Chi, the older brother of Goten, the husband of Videl and father to Pan. He is named after Goku's adoptive grandfather, Gohan.

        Unlike his father, Gohan is a brilliant scholar and lacks a passion for fighting, preferring to do so only when his loved ones are threatened. Nevertheless, he spends much of his life participating in the defense of Earth, often helping to turn the tides when the dormant depths of his power are unleashed.

    <section id="Broly">
        Broly's overall character and the general design of his famous Legendary Super Saiyan state was created by Akira Toriyama (who created the full powered golden hair variant) as well as Takao Koyama. The latter in particular was inspired to create a powerful and menacing Saiyan villain due to watching the transformation sequence of Future Trunks into the Super Saiyan Third Grade in the episode "Trunks Ascends".[8] In his notes for the design of the character, Toriyama mentions that Broly, unlike other Saiyans, does not wear the standard Saiyan Battle Armor due to them being standard issue for Frieza's forces, and Broly is not affiliated with that group. He also added a note regarding a particular concept art depicting him with a tail that he doesn't mind whether or not he has a tail, leaving it ambiguous as to whether or not he had one in the film. He also noted that he slightly redesigned his hair for his next film appearance.
